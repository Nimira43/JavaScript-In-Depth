#### Modernised Adjustments

##### addEventListener: 
###### By 2005-2007, using addEventListener was becoming more common for adding event listeners.

##### forEach: 
###### Introduced in JavaScript 1.6 (2005), forEach was starting to gain traction and replace traditional for loops for iterating over arrays.

##### XMLHttpRequest: 
###### Still the primary method for making asynchronous requests.

##### Inline Event Handlers: 
###### They were beginning to be replaced by addEventListener for cleaner, more maintainable code.

#### Summary

###### This code represents a transitional period in JavaScript's evolution, where developers were moving towards more modern practices but still relying on some older, widely supported features.
