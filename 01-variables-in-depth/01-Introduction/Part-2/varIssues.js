var message = 'This is a message'
// create a memory address for message variable. This memory address has created a binding pointing to the value of the variable.

message = 'This is an updated message'
// reassigning a new value to an existing variable. The memory address of the variable will bind and point to the new value. When garbage collection happens the original value will be removed.
