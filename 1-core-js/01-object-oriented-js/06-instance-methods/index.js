What Are Instance Methods?
Instance methods are functions that are defined inside a class and can be called on instances (objects) of that class. They can access and modify the data held in an instance and perform operations using that data.

Key Points:
Defined in a Class: Instance methods are part of a class definition.

Called on Instances: They can be called on instances of the class.

Access Instance Data: Instance methods can access and modify instance variables (attributes) of the class.

Example in JavaScript:
javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  // Instance Method
  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says Woof!`);
  }
}

// Create an instance of Dog
const myDog = new Dog("Lenny", "Labrador");

// Call the instance method
myDog.bark(); // Output: Lenny says Woof!
How It Works:
Class Definition: Dog is a class with a constructor that initializes name and breed.

Instance Method: bark is an instance method that prints a message.

Create Instance: myDog is an instance of Dog.

Call Method: myDog.bark() calls the instance method, and it uses the instanceâ€™s name attribute.

Benefits of Instance Methods:
Encapsulation: Keep related data and behavior together.

Reusability: Methods can be reused across different instances.

Organization: Help organize code logically within classes.

In Python:
python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

    # Instance Method
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Create an instance of Dog
my_dog = Dog("Lenny", "Labrador")

# Call the instance method
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Lenny says Woof!
In Java:
java
public class Dog {
    private String name;
    private String breed;

    public Dog(String name, String breed) {
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    // Instance Method
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says Woof!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of Dog
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Lenny", "Labrador");

        // Call the instance method
        myDog.bark();  // Output: Lenny says Woof!
    }
}
Summary:
Instance methods are a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allow you to define behavior for your objects, encapsulating related functionality within the class.
