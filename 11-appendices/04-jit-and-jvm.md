#### JavaScript has with JIT and JVM

###### JavaScript's relationship with JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation) and JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is rooted in how these technologies optimise code execution, though they serve different ecosystems. Here's how they connect:

##### JavaScript and JIT
###### JIT Compilation is a key feature of modern JavaScript engines like V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (Safari).

###### These engines use JIT to dynamically compile JavaScript code into machine code at runtime, improving performance by avoiding repeated interpretation.

###### JIT in JavaScript engines identifies "hot spots" (frequently executed code) and optimises them for faster execution, making JavaScript suitable for high-performance applications.

##### JavaScript and JVM

###### While JavaScript doesn't natively run on the JVM, tools like Nashorn (deprecated) and GraalVM allow JavaScript to execute within the JVM environment.

###### These tools enable interoperability between JavaScript and Java, allowing developers to use JavaScript alongside Java in JVM-based applications.

###### In such cases, JavaScript benefits from the JVM's features, including its own JIT compiler, garbage collection, and platform independence.

##### Key Difference

###### JIT in JavaScript engines is tailored specifically for JavaScript's dynamic nature, while the JVM's JIT is designed for Java bytecode. However, both aim to optimise runtime performance by compiling code into machine language.
