#### JavaScript Engines

###### JavaScript engines are specialised programs designed to execute JavaScript code. They play a crucial role in web browsers and other environments by translating human-readable JavaScript into machine code that computers can understand. Here's a breakdown of how they work and their significance:

#### Key Features of JavaScript Engines:
##### Execution:

###### JavaScript engines execute code by combining interpretation and compilation techniques. Modern engines use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles code into machine language on the fly for faster performance.

##### Components:

###### Call Stack: Manages the execution of functions and tracks their order.

###### Heap: Stores objects and dynamic data.

##### Browser Integration:

###### Each browser has its own JavaScript engine:

###### V8: Used in Google Chrome and Node.js..

###### SpiderMonkey: Powers Mozilla Firefox.

###### JavaScriptCore (Nitro): Used in Safari.

###### Chakra: Previously used in Microsoft Edge (legacy).

##### Beyond Browsers:

###### JavaScript engines are not limited to browsers. For example, the V8 engine is integral to server-side environments like Node.js, enabling JavaScript to be used for backend development.

##### Optimisation:

###### Engines optimise code execution by analysing frequently used code paths and improving their performance dynamically.
