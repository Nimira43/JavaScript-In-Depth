#### JavaScript V8 Engine

###### The JavaScript V8 engine is a high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine developed by Google. It powers the Chrome browser and is also used in non-browser environments like Node.js. Here's how it works:

###### V8 compiles JavaScript code into machine code rather than interpreting it line by line. This makes execution faster.

##### Execution Pipeline:

###### It uses an interpreter called Ignition to generate bytecode from JavaScript.

###### The optimising compiler, TurboFan, further refines this bytecode into highly efficient machine code.

##### Memory Management:

###### V8 includes a garbage collector to manage memory automatically, cleaning up unused objects to optimise performance.

##### Applications:

###### Beyond browsers, V8 is integral to server-side JavaScript environments like Node.js, enabling developers to build scalable applications.
