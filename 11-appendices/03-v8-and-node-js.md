#### V8 and Node JS

###### The V8 engine and Node.js share a close relationship, as V8 is the JavaScript engine that powers Node.js. Here's how they connect:

##### V8 Engine:

###### Developed by Google, V8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine written in C++. It compiles JavaScript directly into machine code, making it incredibly fast.

###### Originally designed for the Chrome browser, it was later adapted for other environments, including Node.js.

##### Node.js:

###### Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, enabling server-side development.

###### It uses the V8 engine to execute JavaScript code efficiently. However, Node.js extends V8 by adding libraries and APIs for file systems, networking, and other server-side functionalities.

##### Symbiosis:

###### V8 handles the execution of JavaScript, while Node.js provides the runtime environment and additional tools to build scalable applications.

###### Together, they enable developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side programming.
